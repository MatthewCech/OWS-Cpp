# OnewaySync-Cpp

ToDo:
- Add a .gitignore file to prevent syncing the generated visual studio files -- transfer from another project.
- Rebase to remove the massive commit where I accidentally pushed precompiled headers
- Handle one-way file delivery: Consider making use of the fact that the HTTP standard is a thing.
